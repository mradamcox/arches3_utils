# arches3_utils
A collection of scripts/tools to assist with the creation of Arches v3 apps

Feel free to add/improve these scripts. This repo can be placed anywhere on your hard drive, but you must set the path to your app's settings.py in the `conf` file.

Once you have edited the conf file, rename it `conf.py` so that this repo will ignore it.
