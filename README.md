# arches3_utils
A collection of scripts/tools to assist with the creation of Arches v3 apps

Feel free to add to/improve these scripts. This repo can be placed anywhere on your hard drive, but you must first edit the `conf` file. Once you have done so, rename it `conf.py` so the repo will ignore it.
